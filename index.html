			<p>I am a graphic designer that strives to create clean, stylish and relevant designs. I have great attention to detail and use my creative thinking, aesthetic sense and artistic skills and techniques to deliver the  most coherent designs based on the clients needs and expectations.  Client satisfaction is very important to me and I listen carefuly to their necessities.<br>
			Initiative and decision making are some of my trades as well as managing deadline.
			To keep up-to-date I am always willing to learn new  or improve existing techniques through graphic design websites, magazines, videos, and also with co-workers. I work really well as part of a  team  contributing with ideas and following guidence. Through great time management, flexibility, and organization my objective at every project is to find the most efficient solution to the clientâ€™s designs challenges applying creativity, imagination and an editorial eye. Giving my best effort is always my goal.

			On a personal level, I am from the South of Brazil, a town called Blumenau that is considered a piece of Germany in South America. In my hometown we have Oktoberfest, the second largest beer festival in the World, losing only to the original that happens in Germany. I am married, and I have 2 beautiful boys, Oliver and Enzo. They are the center of my life, and I am taking this course to provide a better future for them! Thanks for stopping by to check my Portfolio, I hope you enjoy it!
